    - I have tried to create a new branch but it is merging to main branch.. 
    - I want to create a new branch and work on it without merging to main branch..

    You can create a new branch without merging to main branch by using the following command:

```sh
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

    This will create a new branch with the specified name and switch to it. You can then make changes to the new branch without affecting the main branch.
